Mon Jun 13 00:11:54 BST 2016

	distance is listed. The default output is 'interface.out'.
	To enable with the switch --intefaceOut.

- 1.7.0
Fri Jun  3 11:35:12 BST 2016
	New feature: Output of the buried SASA (bSASA).
	Assuming SASA is calculated for residue 'i',
	bSASA is summed only over side-chain atoms to form bSASA_phil and
	bSASA_phob, depending upon the hydrophilic or hydrophobic
	nature of the contacting atom. bSASA default output is 'popsb.out'.

	in pops.traj.out.

- 1.3.2 : released
Tue Mar 15 16:38:37 GMT 2011
	Command line argument rProbe was not used in program, but the constant_sasa
	value instead. Fixed that, but segmentation faults appeared for rProbe > 4.

	to 1024 and added assertion '< 1024' to neighbour list construction.

	replaces the '*' in saccharide atom names with '''.
	Added residues DI (2'-DEOXYINOSINE-5'-MONOPHOSPHATE) and I (INOSINIC ACID).
	Residue DN and N seem to be obsolete, but are kept for backward compatibility.

	"Problematic conformation at atom 1168

	Exits with error code 1.
