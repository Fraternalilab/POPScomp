# *POPSR*
The *POPSR* package provides the complex processing routine 'compscomp.R',
plotting functions and a Shiny interface to POPSC,
which is a C program that needs to be compiled separately;
note that you may need to adjust the path of the 'pops' binary in app.R and
popscomp.R in a self-compiled application.
See the  [Wiki](https://github.com/Fraternalilab/POPScomp/wiki) for more information.
