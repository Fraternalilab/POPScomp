# POPS all XML files of the PDB database
Run POPS over the entire PDB database (in XML format)
and create output in JSON format for the FunPDBe daabase.

## Weekly run
The pipeline is run weekly via a cron job on the virtual machine 'ace'
hosted by the Synology computer 'FFJK'.
The main steps are a PDB update, POPS invocation for new structures and
uploading of the new JSON output to the FunPDBe database.

Failed POPS computations lead to a NULL symbolic link as JSON output
and those structures will be (occasionally) debugged in batch mode,
which is explained in *Makefile.debug* below.

Some larger PDB files create a stack buffer overflow on 'FFJK', which is not
reproducible on a laptop running the same software. Also 'valgrind' does not
show any memory leaks. For this type of PDB structure, occasionally the pipeline
needs to be manually run on a laptop and the access mode of the created JSON files
should be adjusted via the 'make reown' step of the pipeline.

## Directory layout
- PDBML : clone of PDB database in *XML* format containing \*.xml.gz
- JSON : contains POPS output in *JSON* format
- JSONVAL : contains symbolic links to validated *JSON* output files

These directories live under *DBDIR*, which is different from
the program path *FUNPDBEDIR*, both of which can be set in the
master Makefile. 

PDB input, *JSON* and *JSONVAL* are in separate directories,
which works best for updates (rsync --delete), *lftp* uploads and
general debugging purposes. *make* has been adpted to that
directory structure through macros and *vpath* directives.

## Master *Makefile*
- The *XML* version of the PDB database (PDBML) is updated.
- The *JSON* output directory structure is being created 
    and the subdirectory structure of *PDBML* is mirrored.
- All structure files in PDBML are symbolically linked in
    the *JSON* directory.
- Loops over all subdirectories, invoking the *Makefile.subdir*.

## Invoked *Makefile.subdir*
- Run various targets using *Makefile*.
- A macro creates a list of all structure files in the current
    (sub)directory and parses \*.xml.gz into \*.json dependencies.
- POPS is invoked for each dependency file.
- POPS errors are ignored (i.e. *make* processing is not terminated)
    because of the leading '-' in the command call.
- Run quality controls: rename output files after POPS success,
    remove empty files where POPS failed and change the file access mode.

## Invoked *Makefile.validate*
- Run 'make validate' using *Makefile*.
- A macro creates a list of all *JSON* files.
- The python validator *funpdbe\_client.py* is invoked for each
    dependency file.
- If validation is successful, a symbolic link is created
    that points to the *JSON* file.
- Remove all files with a broken symbolic link.

## Invoked *Makefile.upload*
- Run 'make mkupload' using *Makefile*.
- Uploads add *JSON* output via 'lftp' to FunPDBe site.
    The 'mirror -RL' option uploads the files to which the symbolic links point. 

## Invoked *Makefile.debug*
This is intended to be run manually and not as part of the weekly pipeline.
Some structures fail to create *JSON* output because of problems in the structure
(too close atoms) or because of technical problems (buffer overflow).
Those structures should be removed from the local reference PDB database to avoid weekly
re-computation of the same failure. This is done via a file 'nullFiles.dat' that contains
the names of all the failed PDB structures and that is used for '--exclude-from'
in the weekly *rsync* from the public PDB database. The 'nullFiles.dat' structures are
to be moved to the *XMLexclude* directory for further analysis.
The *Makefile.debug* replaces zero-sized *JSON* files with symbolic links to NULL
to mark the missing output. Running the 'run\_nullFiles.bash' script logs the *POPS*
output containing the error message in the *JSON* directory under the structure's name.
- Run 'make lsnull' using *Makefile* to create a 'nullFiles.dat' list of failed structures.
    Remember that this file is also used by the weekly *rsync* of the PDB database.
- Move all structures in 'nullFiles.dat' to *XMLexclude*.
- Run 'make debug' using *Makefile*.
- Run 'run\_nullFiles.bash' to create error logs for all failed structrures.

### nullFiles\_210106.dat
First complete list of failed structures.
Using the script *run_nullFiles.bash*,
this list was run again to create logfiles in the directory *JSON*.
The files *nullFiles\_210106\_debugged\_..._210220.dat* list different subsets
of structures depending on the presence and content of their log files. 

## Parallelism
Make is run in parallel by using the '-j' flag:
```
make -j 8 mkpops 2>&1 | tee mkpops.`date +%Y%m%d.%H%M`.log &
```
For split runs:
```
make -j 4 mkpops1 2>&1 | tee mkpops1.`date +%Y%m%d.%H%M`.log &
make -j 4 mkpops2 2>&1 | tee mkpops2.`date +%Y%m%d.%H%M`.log &
make -j 4 mkpops3 2>&1 | tee mkpops3.`date +%Y%m%d.%H%M`.log &
```
