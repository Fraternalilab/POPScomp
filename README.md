The POPScomp program computes the Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA)
of a given PDB structure. If the structure is a complex, *i.e.* composed of more than one chain
containing protein or RNA/DNA, POPScomp computes additionally the SASA buried between chains.
The name 'POPS' is derived from **P**arameter **OP**timised **S**urfaces, because its parametrisation
was performed by regression against a large set of protein and RNA/DNA structures.
Details of those routines are explained in the
[published papers](https://github.com/Fraternalilab/POPScomp/#References).
(Note: POPScomp embodies both methods, POPS and POPSCOMP).

## Installation
There are 3 ways to (install and) use POPScomp,
please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Fraternalilab/POPScomp/wiki) for details:
1. Use the free POPScomp *Shiny* server at [popscomp.org](http://popscomp.org:3838) without installation.
2. Download the [POPScomp *Docker* image](https://hub.docker.com/u/popscomp) and run the *Shiny* App on your local computer.
3. To install from source code, either download the [latest release](https://github.com/Fraternalilab/POPScomp/releases/latest) or the development version by cloning this POPScomp repository.
[Compile/install](https://github.com/Fraternalilab/POPScomp/wiki/Installation) the program suite and run the *Shiny* App on your local computer.


## Usage
Enter a PDB identifier or upload a custom PDB file and press 'run POPScomp'.
Results will be shown as tables for different resolutions: Atom, Residue, Chain and Molecule.
Download individual results *via* the buttons underneath the tables or bundled *via* the
'Download All Results' button.

## Documentation
Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Fraternalilab/POPScomp/wiki) for documentation.


## Software Design
This POPScomp repository contains the following components:

#### POPSC
A GNU Autotools package of the POPS C program that computes SASA for a given structure.
  
#### POPSR
An R package to
- split complexes into single and pair components to compute buried SASA using POPSC and 
- provide a *Shiny* App as interface to the POPSC program.

#### *Docker* Image
A [POPScomp *Docker* image](https://hub.docker.com/u/popscomp) is available that provides 
the program suite in fully functional form,
*i.e.* pre-compiled POPSC, RStudio with POPSR and all dependencies installed.
Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Fraternalilab/POPScomp/wiki/Docker-Image)
for detailed guidelines on downloading and usage of the Docker image.

#### FunPDBe
A *Make* pipeline to run POPScomp over the PDB database and to feed the JSON output into the [Elixir FunPDBe project](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe-kb/funpdbe).
To include newly added PDB structures, the pipeline is run *via* a cron *@weekly* job on a virtual
Ubuntu machine hosted on a Synology DS218+ computer. 
This directory has been included purely as a reference for the FunPDBe project and is not intended as a user-facing application.
However, some users might find the pipeline or parts of it useful for their own purposes.


## Servers

#### POPScomp *Shiny* server at [popscomp.org](http://popscomp.org:3838)
Publically available server with an intuitive user interface.
Results will be stored on the server until midnight (GMT).
For permanent storage, please download your results via the 'Download' buttons.

#### FunPDBe
POPScomp is part of the [FunPDBe resources](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/funpdbe/deposition).

#### Note on legacy sites
* mathbio.nimr.mrc.ac.uk/POPSCOMP : This was the original address of the POPS and POPSCOMP servers in the Division of Mathematical Biology at the NIMR institute, which has been closed in 2015 and became a part of the Francis Crick Institute.
* mathbio.crick.mrc.ac.uk/POPSCOMP : For a short while, the POPS and POPSCOMP servers were running in the Francis Crick Institute, but the institute's administration decided to stop support.
