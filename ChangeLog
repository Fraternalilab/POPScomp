#===============================================================================

- 3.2.2
Sun 26 Mar 12:28:23 BST 2023
	
	Changed branch name 'master' to 'main', because that is now the
	standard in GitHub and the CI failed.	

	Virtual instance updated to Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-1030-gcp x86_64)
	Re-installation of R packages, POPSR and re-compilation of POPSC.

Mon Oct 25 17:20:19 BST 2021
	runID now also dependent on PDBfile upload

- 3.2.1
Sat 28 Aug 12:13:14 BST 2021
	Fixed non functional button 'Download All Results'.
	Now a run ID is created as a digest of the system time whenever
	the input parameters are modified. That run ID is used for the name of
	the output directory and its zip file. It is also used for all other
	downloaded files. That way files belonging to the same run are tied
	together by a unique identifier.

- 3.1.8
	Added "busyIndicator" from "shinysky" library to flag background computation.

- 3.1.7
Wed 23 Dec 09:30:46 GMT 2020
	The Shiny interface fails when a (single-chain) protein has no chain name,
	because the white space is interpreted as missing "chain" column.
	This has now been corrected in POPS by inserting a '-' chain character.

- 3.1.6
Sun 20 Sep 18:18:55 BST 2020
	Fixed multi-chain error; 'wait' switch for system calls
	Fixed two bugs in 'dim' calls.

	Removed sensitive file.

- 3.1.4

- 3.1.3
commit/034ee1f0104474f644059fbc39c3c57562e3d90e
	Improved initialisation and re-running of app.

- 3.1.2

	Corrected output file names for --rout.
	  Previous names broke Shiny app.

- 3.0.3

	Makefile pipeline for large-scale run over PDBML.
	Run over >150000 structures (all <4MB) of PDBML.
	Validated output.
	Uploaded output to FunPDBe server using 'lftp'.

- 3.0.2
Fri 20 Dec 10:00:19 GMT 2019
	Made PDBML version memory clean; just DLL libraries flag problems in
	  valgrind, but that is likely a valgrind bug.
	Added OpenMP support instead of MPI support, but requires code change.
	  topol.c:nonbonded memory allocation outside loop, for example
	Removed MPI support
	Changed to error exit=0 and empty <pdbID>.json output

- 3.0.1
Sat 23 Nov 15:34:37 GMT 2019
	Fixed bug: Now PDB identifier is read correctly from XML file.
	Removed HET atom matching until POPSCOMP functionality reinstated.

Mon Jun 13 00:11:54 BST 2016
	New feature: Output of a nearest neighbour list between
	distinct chains, where only the contact residue with the shortest
	distance is listed. The default output is 'interface.out'.
	To enable with the switch --intefaceOut.

- 1.7.0
Fri Jun  3 11:35:12 BST 2016
	New feature: Output of the buried SASA (bSASA).
	Assuming SASA is calculated for residue 'i',
	bSASA is summed only over side-chain atoms to form bSASA_phil and
	bSASA_phob, depending upon the hydrophilic or hydrophobic
	nature of the contacting atom. bSASA default output is 'popsb.out'.

- 1.6.5
Sat May 28 17:17:42 BST 2016

	Few weeks ago, changed wrong return status back to zero.

- 1.6.2
Wed Nov  6 17:48:11 GMT 2013
	Added suggestion if no bonds are found: use '--coarse'.
	Now exiting when the same atom is used for distance calculations because
	of atom clashes. This leads to segmentation faults otherwise.

- 1.6.1
Tue Oct  8 15:15:03 BST 2013

	Removed bug in %SASA calculation.

- 1.5.3
Wed May  2 18:40:55 BST 2012

	file for each trajectory structure and the output per structure is
	using the same parameter settings as the main output.

- 1.5.2
Tue Oct 25 15:20:21 BST 2011

	in pops.traj.out.

- 1.3.2 : released
Tue Mar 15 16:38:37 GMT 2011
	Command line argument rProbe was not used in program, but the constant_sasa
	value instead. Fixed that, but segmentation faults appeared for rProbe > 4.

	Added output file name to stdout.

Fri Dec 11 13:42:24 GMT 2009

	to indicate 0=error-free, -1=warning or 1=error.

- 1.2.3

	replaces the '*' in saccharide atom names with '''.
	Added residues DI (2'-DEOXYINOSINE-5'-MONOPHOSPHATE) and I (INOSINIC ACID).
	Residue DN and N seem to be obsolete, but are kept for backward compatibility.
