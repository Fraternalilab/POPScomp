# POPScomp Docker container
Since end of 2025, the 'Dockerfile' performs all the necessary
installation steps and can be invoked using the scripts:
```
make_Docker_[Mac|Linux].bash
```

Installation instructions are given in the Wiki of the
POPScomp GitHub repository.


The legacy installations scripts 'onContainer_\*.bash'
are kept here as a fall-back solution.
